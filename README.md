# Emerald Beyond

## What is this?

This is WIP decomp hack based on [RHH's pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) and [pret's pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) project. It's currently roughly 25% complete depending on how bad my scope creep gets.

**THIS IS NOT AND WILL NEVER BE FOR SALE OR PROFIT**

The goals of the hack are as follows:
- Create an expanded version of Emerald offering modern features, convenience, and additional content
- Create a wealth of player choice through customization and options
- Create a world that feels more real and alive through dynamic and time-based events
- Maintain the feel and polish of an official game
